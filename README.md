munkres-arma
===========

An implementation of the Kuhnâ€“Munkres algorithm forked from [John Weaver](http://saebyn.info/2007/05/22/munkres-code-v2/).
Heavily inspired by [Munkres-opencv](http://soimy.github.io/munkres-opencv/).
Simplified code and ported to support [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) only.
arma::Mat has been used instead of John's matrix class.

Usage
-----

You should have [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) installed to use this.
For Windows user, Visual Studio 2010 project file is included.
Basic usage can be referred from `main.cpp`
